Learning how to use this tool

Hi, I like programming, but I did not have a oportunity to work directly with it yet. My whole carrear back in Brazil was working at Insurance Companies as Claim Analist.
I had my first contact with programing at Sumare University in Computer Sciency bachelor, using C and C++ languages.
